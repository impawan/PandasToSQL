This repository contains the resource that helps in understanding how we can implement the SQL like functionality in Pandas dataframes in python
We will use the pubg death data to compare the SQL in datbase(Oracle) and SQL in pandas
The file convertcsv.sql is database insert script which contains the 50000 rows from orginal pubg data. The whole pubg data can be download from kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/skihikingkevin/pubg-match-deaths
